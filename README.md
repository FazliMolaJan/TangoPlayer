# TangoPlayer
Have you ever studied English?
How did you do that?
Me, I love to watch sitcom "The big bang theory" to do that.
Sometimes I meet phrases I've never know.
I use a flash card on the app, but it takes time to add it to the card. :(

With this app, you only need just one tap to add it.
---That's why I am making this app.
